      "the largest PDF dataset ever released, spanning over half a billion documents!\n",
      "\n",
      "- Long context: Documents are 2x longer than web text\n",
      "- 3T tokens from high-demand domains like legal and science.\n",
      "- Heavily improves over SoTA when mixed with FW-EDU&DCLM web copora.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the beginning of this year, many have started asking: what happens when we run out of web pages to train on? Have we really hit the data wall? 💥\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, only a few knew about a data source that everyone avoided for ages, due to its incredible extraction cost and complexity; PDFs.\n",
      "\n",
      "While PDFs are definitely hard to extract, unlike HTML-based datasets, they're prevalent in high-demand quality domains such as legal, science, something so valuable but hard to find.\n",
      "Yet even largest corpora (CC-PDF), is only scratching 🤏 the surface of what's possible to extract from CommonCrawl PDFs.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why we built a 2-tier pipeline to unlock all those “imprisoned tokens”:  \n",
      "1️⃣ Extractable text PDFs → 🦆 Docling → efficient, good quality  \n",
      "2️⃣ Scanned PDFs → 🤖 rolmOCR → higher cost, great quality\n",
      "\n",
      "Once extracted, we refined the data with model-based filtering + deduplication, resulting in documents that are on average 2x longer than web text and substantially higher quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, to confirm FinePDFs’ quality, we compared against major HTML-based corpora.\n",
      "- Despite minimal filtering, our dataset nearly matches heavily filtered FW-EDU&DCLM.  \n",
      "- More importantly, when mixed together, it achieves new SoTA, with substantial improvements over other mixtures 📈.\n",
